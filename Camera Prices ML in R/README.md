These files present a statistical analysis of camera data, focusing on variables such as price, megapixels, weight, and brand (Canon vs. Nikon). The analysis includes normality testing (rejecting normality for most variables), linear regression modeling to predict price, and model comparisons using adjusted R-squared and residual diagnostics. The final model (m3) incorporating megapixels, weight, and score showed improved explanatory power, though residual plots indicated potential non-linearities, suggesting limitations in linear assumptions for prediction accuracy.
