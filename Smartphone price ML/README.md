This project analyzed smartphone price determinants using a dataset of 1,200+ devices. After cleaning and transforming data (handling missing values, log-transforming prices, and encoding brands), exploratory analysis revealed correlations between price, RAM, storage, and display size. A decision tree regression model outperformed linear, lasso, and ridge models, achieving the highest accuracy (RÂ²=0.77) in predicting prices.
